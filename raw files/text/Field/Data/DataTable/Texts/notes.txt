these ought to be templated properly with 010 or ImHex to make editing them easier,
but for now we'll have to edit these files manually.


the offsets for names of the bathroom locations are listed below in hex + the specfic file to edit

DT_FldDailyHitName
	0x2DBB - Men's Room
	0x2E2D - Women's Room
	0x3FCF - Men's Room
	0x4041 - Women's Room

DT_FldPlaceName
	0x1755 - Men's Room
	0x17AA - Women's Room

the strings in these files appear to be null-terminated (meaning that the byte after the last
character of the string will be 0x0) however they also have an additional byte after that;
not quite sure what it's for but probably a good idea to maintain that formatting
when making edits to be sure nothing breaks)
	DT_FldDailyHitName seems to use 0x08 as this extra byte, DT_FldPlaceName uses 0x70

note as well that the last 4 bytes of a "chunk" in the file will also define the length in bytes
(including the 0x00 null-terminating byte) of the next string, so make sure to change those as well

ideally some kind of merging or dumping solution to more easily make these files editable & mergeable
in the future should be made but that's outside the scope of this project LMAO :naosmiley:


DT_FldDailyHitName format notes:
	names are stored in chunks which start with a 0x08 byte
	and contain data defining the properties of the name, ending off with the string itself
	0x42 bytes from the 0x08 byte is the index value of the name

DT_FldPlaceName ROF size:
	offset to start selection for size value: 0xB64
	offset for size value: 0xB08

DT_FldPlaceName format notes:
	number of strings defined at 0xB8D in uasset (unsure of where file data actually starts)
	formatted by chunks: header (starting byte 0x70) followed by length of string followed by string
