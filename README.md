Contributions come in all shapes and sizes, and here, all are welcome. If your masterpiece isn't quite ready for the main stage, your fork awaits. It's a place for refinement and creativity.

### The Key Quests
Our quests span across realms - from 3D modeling to UI design, from rewriting texts to reanimating cutscenes. Each task is a notch in the pathway for doing what Atlus doesn't.

- Document your 3D modeling escapades, breathing life into Kotone's character.
- Paint the UI with Kotone's essence, making every pixel count.
- Rewrite dialogues, bestowing Kotone with a voice that echoes and differentiates her from Makoto.
- Craft cutscenes that captivate, placing Kotone at the heart of the narrative.
- Weave animations with finesse, bringing fluidity to Kotone's every move.

As you venture forth:
- Chronicle your journey, detailing every artistic conquest and technical triumph.
- Attune your senses to the harmony of voices, ensuring they resonate with our narrative.
- Herald your achievements, signaling the audio alchemists to concoct their aural elixirs.
- Archive anomalies and curiosities, for some enigmas require a collective wit to unravel.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
